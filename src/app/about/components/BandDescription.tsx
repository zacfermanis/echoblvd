          Echo Blvd is a five-piece rock band with classic swagger and alt-rock grit. Boston’s Zac Fermanis fronts local vets Tom Kuhn, Jeremy Buenviaje, and Scott Little. From club to party, they bring tight grooves, raw vocals, and serious energy.

          Expanding that spirit, Echo Blvd blends the urgency of 90s alternative with the polish of modern rock—anthemic hooks, wide-screen guitars, and rhythms that refuse to sit still. Onstage they trade in catharsis: honest lyrics, sweat-soaked sets, and a crew-wide chemistry that turns rooms electric. Whether it’s a headline night in a city club or a backyard blowout, the band shows up to move hearts and bodies in equal measure.
