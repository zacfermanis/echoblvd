## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Next.js 14+ with App Router**: Modern React framework with excellent performance
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid development
- **Server Components by default**: Better performance, use client only when needed
- **TDD workflow**: Test-driven development for all features
- **YouTube embeds for video**: Replaced large MP4 files to avoid deployment issues
- **Development mode email fallback**: Contact form logs data in development when email config is missing

### Design Considerations
- **Mobile-first approach**: Responsive design starting from mobile
- **Band aesthetic**: Design should reflect Echo Blvd's musical style
- **Performance focus**: Fast loading times for music content
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Video optimization**: Use YouTube embeds instead of self-hosted large files

### Content Strategy
- **Static content**: Markdown files for band information
- **Dynamic data**: JSON files for shows, music, social links
- **SEO optimization**: Meta tags, structured data, sitemap
- **Image optimization**: WebP format, lazy loading
- **Video content**: YouTube embeds for better performance and reliability

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **TDD is non-negotiable**: Every feature starts with a failing test
- **Functional programming**: Pure functions, immutability, composition
- **Small, focused components**: Single responsibility principle
- **Self-documenting code**: Clear naming over comments
- **Options objects**: For function parameters with multiple options

### Code Quality Standards
- **No `any` types**: Use `unknown` if type truly unknown
- **No type assertions**: Unless absolutely necessary
- **Behavior-driven testing**: Test public APIs, not implementation
- **100% coverage**: Through business behavior, not implementation details

### Project Organization
- **Feature-based structure**: Organize by feature, not file type
- **Shared components**: Reusable UI components in components/ui
- **Type definitions**: Centralized in types directory
- **Utility functions**: Pure functions in lib directory

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights
- **Memory Bank approach**: Essential for maintaining context across sessions
- **TDD workflow**: Ensures all code is driven by business requirements
- **Performance-first**: Server Components provide better performance by default
- **Accessibility from start**: Easier to build in than retrofit
- **Video hosting**: YouTube embeds are more reliable than self-hosted large files
- **Development environment handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing configuration improve developer experience

### Potential Challenges
- **Content management**: Need to establish content workflow early
- **Audio integration**: Music player components will need client-side functionality
- **Image optimization**: Band photos and album art need proper optimization
- **SEO implementation**: Structured data for band information

### Success Factors
- **Clear project structure**: Well-organized codebase for maintainability
- **Performance optimization**: Fast loading times for better user experience
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Majority of users will access on mobile devices
- **SEO optimization**: Important for band discovery and fan acquisition
- **Reliable video delivery**: YouTube embeds ensure consistent playback

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Content implementation (Phase 3)
- **Progress**: Music page complete with two YouTube covers (Stone Temple Pilots and Foo Fighters), no Spotify or streaming links, Turbopack config migration complete, Contact page fully implemented with email functionality
- **Next milestone**: Shows page implementation
- **Blockers**: None currently identified

## Immediate Actions Required
1. Implement shows page with tour dates
2. Create about page with band information
3. âœ… Contact page with form functionality (COMPLETED)
