   - Build about page with band member information
   - Develop contact page with form functionality

2. **Phase 3: Interactive Features**
   - Add music player component
   - Implement newsletter signup
   - Create social media integration
   - Add image gallery for band photos

3. **Phase 4: Content Management**
   - Add more sample content (tracks, albums, shows)
   - Implement content loading utilities
   - Create reusable UI components
   - Add SEO optimization

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Next.js 14+ with App Router**: Modern React framework with excellent performance
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid development
- **Server Components by default**: Better performance, use client only when needed
- **TDD workflow**: Test-driven development for all features

### Design Considerations
- **Mobile-first approach**: Responsive design starting from mobile
- **Band aesthetic**: Design should reflect Echo Blvd's musical style
- **Performance focus**: Fast loading times for music content
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Content Strategy
- **Static content**: Markdown files for band information
- **Dynamic data**: JSON files for shows, music, social links
- **SEO optimization**: Meta tags, structured data, sitemap
- **Image optimization**: WebP format, lazy loading

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Patterns
- **TDD is non-negotiable**: Every feature starts with a failing test
- **Functional programming**: Pure functions, immutability, composition
- **Small, focused components**: Single responsibility principle
- **Self-documenting code**: Clear naming over comments
- **Options objects**: For function parameters with multiple options

### Code Quality Standards
- **No `any` types**: Use `unknown` if type truly unknown
- **No type assertions**: Unless absolutely necessary
- **Behavior-driven testing**: Test public APIs, not implementation
- **100% coverage**: Through business behavior, not implementation details

### Project Organization
- **Feature-based structure**: Organize by feature, not file type
- **Shared components**: Reusable UI components in components/ui
- **Type definitions**: Centralized in types directory
- **Utility functions**: Pure functions in lib directory

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights
- **Memory Bank approach**: Essential for maintaining context across sessions
- **TDD workflow**: Ensures all code is driven by business requirements
- **Performance-first**: Server Components provide better performance by default
- **Accessibility from start**: Easier to build in than retrofit

### Potential Challenges
- **Content management**: Need to establish content workflow early
- **Audio integration**: Music player components will need client-side functionality
- **Image optimization**: Band photos and album art need proper optimization
- **SEO implementation**: Structured data for band information

### Success Factors
- **Clear project structure**: Well-organized codebase for maintainability
- **Performance optimization**: Fast loading times for better user experience
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Majority of users will access on mobile devices
- **SEO optimization**: Important for band discovery and fan acquisition

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Project initialization
- **Progress**: Memory Bank documentation complete
- **Next milestone**: Next.js project setup and basic structure
- **Blockers**: None currently identified

## Immediate Actions Required
1. Initialize Next.js project with proper configuration
2. Set up development environment and tooling
3. Create basic project structure
4. Implement foundation components
5. Begin TDD workflow for first features
