## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Next.js 14+**: Chosen for modern React development and excellent performance
- **TypeScript strict mode**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, responsive development
- **TDD workflow**: Non-negotiable for all development
- **Server Components**: Default approach for better performance

### Technical Decisions
- **App Router**: Modern Next.js routing system
- **Static generation**: For optimal performance
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design approach
- **Accessibility-first**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance from start

### Content Strategy
- **Static content**: Markdown files for band information
- **Dynamic data**: JSON files for shows and music
- **Image optimization**: WebP format with lazy loading
- **SEO focus**: Structured data and meta tags
